# libqodot-cpp & libmap-cpp

Godot engine libmap-cpp bindings

Originally ported by [EIRTeam](https://github.com/EIRTeam/qodot).

Includes a port of [libmap](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/libmap/) to C++ (allowing multiple instances of the Qodot class) and a port of the main Qodot library to C++ as a Godot engine module.
